- MOD_BD_20160915 (issue isandlatech/cohorte-platforms/issues/82)
 - using HttpServiceAvailabilityChecker service component to check if Http Service is really started and port is affected.
   the port assigned to service property "org.osgi.service.http.port" is wrong. The good one returned by this service if located on "osgi.http.service.endpoints" service property of HttpService.


- MOD_OG_20160726
 - add protection against NullPointerException during the reading the content of the response of a peer (@see HttpTransport.sendRequest())
